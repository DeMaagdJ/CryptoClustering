#  CryptoClustering
##  Module 19 HW Assignment


In this challenge, youâ€™ll use your knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

## Methods:

* Load and preprocess the data
* Normalize the data using StandardScaler
* Find the best value for k using the elbow method
* Cluster the data with K-Means using the original data market_data_df2
* Run PCA to reduce the dimensions  to three principal components
* Re-evaluate the best value for k using the elbow method
* Cluster the PCA driven data
* Visualize and compare composite plots of both the elbow plots and K-Means cluster plots.
* Determine the impact the reduction of feautures has on the data.

## Results:

#### __Original crypto currency data looking at the price change percentages over the course of different time durations__

## Question: 

* After visually analyzing the cluster analysis results, what is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?

## Answer: 

* The impact of utilizing a principal component analysis is that by reducing the dimensions tested, the algorithm makes the data simplier to explore. Our first K-Means clusters plotted are not highly segregated. The inflection point on both elbow plots are at the same point, determining 4 clusters is our optimal cluster count. The PCA plot reduces the dimensions of our data removing outliers from our plot, making it clearer to distinguish the data.
